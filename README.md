The research on this project is developing the best combination of Detection model and Tracking algorithm, and how the Field of Views' (FoV) are affecting the quality of detections.

Purpose: Getting the accurate count in the Precision Agriculture is a challenging task, so we tried to explore and build best, light weight combination of the detection model and tracking algorithm that delivers the accurate count of tiny objects which can also be used in real-time.

Detection Models: YOLOv8 (n, s, m, l), YOLOv9 (t, s, m, c), YOLOv10 (n, s, m, b)
Tracking Alg: BoT-SORT, ByteTrack, SORT.
